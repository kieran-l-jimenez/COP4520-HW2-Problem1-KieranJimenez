## Problem 1: Minotaur’s Birthday Party (50 points) 
The Minotaur invited N guests to his birthday party. When the guests arrived, he made 
the following announcement. 
The guests may enter his labyrinth, one at a time and only when he invites them to do 
so. At the end of the labyrinth, the Minotaur placed a birthday cupcake on a plate. When 
a guest finds a way out of the labyrinth, he or she may decide to eat the birthday 
cupcake or leave it. If the cupcake is eaten by the previous guest, the next guest will find 
the cupcake plate empty and may request another cupcake by asking the Minotaur’s 
servants. When the servants bring a new cupcake the guest may decide to eat it or leave 
it on the plate. 
The Minotaur’s only request for each guest is to not talk to the other guests about her or 
his visit to the labyrinth after the game has started. The guests are allowed to come up 
with a strategy prior to the beginning of the game. There are many birthday cupcakes, so 
the Minotaur may pick the same guests multiple times and ask them to enter the 
labyrinth. Before the party is over, the Minotaur wants to know if all of his guests have 
had the chance to enter his labyrinth. To do so, the guests must announce that they have 
all visited the labyrinth at least once. 
Now the guests must come up with a strategy to let the Minotaur know that every guest 
entered the Minotaur’s labyrinth. It is known that there is already a birthday cupcake left 
at the labyrinth’s exit at the start of the game. How would the guests do this and not 
disappoint his generous and a bit temperamental host? 
Create a program to simulate the winning strategy (protocol) where each guest is 
represented by one running thread. In your program you can choose a concrete number 
for N or ask the user to specify N at the start. 

## Solution:
N set to 5 (1 Leader, 4 Normie Guests)
Strategy? One guest (Leader) is chosen to order new cupcakes, everyone else only eats them if they see it
and haven't eaten one yet. Once Leader has ordered NumGuests-2 fresh cupcakes (-1 for starting cake, -1 
because he doesn't get one ;( ) he knows by counting that everyone else has had a cupcake and entered the 
labyrinth at least once.
